# <center> Froggo : The Journey <center>
<center> A mix of Tetris and Crossy Road made for Micro:Bit microchips <center>

## Motivation
We were bored and made a little project using MicroPython. <br>
This project was never supposed to be a big project, but community feedback would be appreciated.

## Tech / Frameworks Used
* [microbit module](https://microbit.org/guide/python)
* [Python 3.6.7](https://www.python.org/)

## Code Example / API Reference 
MicroBit chip can't read python code, but it can read hex code. This python code is translated into hex code using [ this ](https://www.python.microbit.org/) python to hex converter. <br>
That converter has already microbit module installed so it is our go-to. <br>
<br>
We use heavy OOP style of code for this project while not being oversimplified.

```python
class Frog():
    def __init__(self, x):
        self.x = x
        self.y = 4
        self.brightness = 7
        self.isAlive = True
        display.set_pixel(self.x, self.y, self.brightness)
    def strafe(self, pos):
        display.set_pixel(self.x, self.y, 0)
        if self.x < 4 and pos == "right":
            self.x += 1
        if self.x > 0 and pos == "left":
            self.x -=1
        display.set_pixel(self.x, self.y, self.brightness)  
    def die(self):
        #global score
        self.isAlive = False
        display.scroll("u ded fam")
        display.scroll("score : " + str(score))
        display.clear()
```
We are facing a big problem where after 25 cars have passed, the chip runs out of RAM memory and the program raises `MemoryError`. <br>
Every single feature is implemented through classes or functions. <br>
Micropython doesn't support [async](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html) module.

## Tests
There aren't any tests need at the moment, but manual tests are really important. <br>
For this project, everything above Python 3.6 will be absolutely fine. Take a look [here](https://microbit-micropython.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) about micropython and it's features and limitations.
